I worked as a tutor in the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh early 2020 until early 2024 while I was a PhD student there. 
Before that, I held a similar role in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Glasgow during the last year of my undergraduate in 2017--18 
and was also a "mentor" in an intensive international summer school run by the School of Physics and Astronomy in 2016 and again in 2018. 
I also volunteered as a helped in the [MacLaurin Society's](https://macsoc.weebly.com/) maths help room (2016--17) and have done various other informal maths tutoring work and volunteering.

While at Edinburgh, I was part of the [Maxwell Institutue Graduate School's](https://www.maxwell.ac.uk/graduate-school/) teaching stream 
and participated in the [Edinburgh Teaching Award (EdTA)](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/associate-fellowship) professional development scheme 
through which I earned [AFHEA](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/associate-fellowship) status.
