I'm a mathematical physics researcher interested in many areas of pure mathematics and physics but with a focus on differential geometry, algebra, and their applications to high-energy and gravitational physics.

The main theme of my research so far has been the application of Lie superalgebra cohomology to the study of supersymmetric geometries [in supergravity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05775) and [beyond](https://doi.org/10.3842/SIGMA.2025.081), with geometric spin-offs including the study of some [unusual types of Killing spinors which generate Lie (superalgebras)](https://doi.org/10.3842/SIGMA.2025.082) and [generalised spin structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03627). This was the topic of my PhD, which I obtained at the University of Edinburgh in 2024. [You can read my thesis here](http://dx.doi.org/10.7488/era/4477).
<!-- For more on this topic and the people working on it, see [the webpage of the Spencer Research Group](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~jmf/SRG/) of which I am a member. -->
I have also done [some work](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07405) in symplectic geometry applied to dynamical systems with many symmetries, which I intend to return to soon. 
All of my publications and preprints are listed on [the research page](research).

I also have significant teaching experience, having taught on courses at all levels of university mathematics, from pre-university summer school to graduate courses, as well as some physics courses. I describe my teaching experience in more detail on [the teaching page](teaching).

**I am currently searching for a postdoctoral research position.**
