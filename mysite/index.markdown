I'm a mathematical physics researcher interested in many areas of pure mathematics and physics but with a focus on geometry and algebra and their applications to high-energy and gravitational physics. 
I obtained my PhD at the University of Edinburgh in 2024, writing my thesis on applications of Lie superalgebra cohomology to supersymmetric geometries in supergravity and generalisations thereof, a topic I'm still currently working on. 
For more on this topic and the people working on it, see [this webpage](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~jmf/SRG/) of which I am a member. 
I have also done some work in symplectic geometry applied to dynamical systems with many symmetrie which I intend to return to soon.

During my academic career, I have also done a significant amount of teaching, covering courses at all levels of university mathematics, including mathematical physics, as well as some physics courses. I describe my teaching experience in more detail [on the teaching page](teaching).

**I am currently searching for a post-doctoral research position.**
